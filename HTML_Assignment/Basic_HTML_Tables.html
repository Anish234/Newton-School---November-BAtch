<!-- Make a table in HTML utilizing proper HTML semantics like thead,th,tbody,etc

The table should have two columns, one for "Roll number" and another for "Name". So, the table header should have two cells, to represent both of them.

The table should have at least two rows of data. -->


<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>ROll number</th>
            <th>Name</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>1.</td>
            <td>Anish</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>2.</td>
            <td>Yash</td>
