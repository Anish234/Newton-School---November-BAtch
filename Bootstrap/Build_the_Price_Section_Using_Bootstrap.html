<!-- Build the Price Section Using Bootstrap
In this task, you'll be creating a navbar and cards using bootstrap. Also, you'll be making the cards responsive.

Navbar styles:

The navbar should have a light background color, with left and right padding of 5.

The anchor tag with class navigation-company-name should have the navbar brand class, and the text should have be of font h1.

For the .navigation-links, the links should have the flex display with links aligned next to each other in a row.

Now, create three navlinks with anchor tags of text Pricing, Features, and About Us.

Every nav link should have a left margin of 3 and the first nav link, that is, Pricing should have the active class.



main tag styles:

The main tag with class pricing-heading should have the text centrally aligned.

Display the content, inside the main tag, as h1 above the p tag using flex property, that is, the flex direction should be column.

Give it a margin from the top of 4, and a gap of 3.

Add a padding from left and right of 5, and top and bottom padding of 3.



div with class pricing-section styles:

The div with class pricing-section should have the text centrally aligned and the content should also be at the center of the screen and in a row.

Cards' header and body have already been provided in the HTML boilerplate. Every card should have left and right margin of 2, and top and bottom margin of 3.

The button of the first card should be outline-primary with size large, and should occupy 100% width.

For the rest of the two cards, buttons should be primary with size large and should occupy 100 percent width.

Make the cards section responsive, such that,


on a desktop, all three cards should be placed within a row, and as the screen size decrease, it should change the layout dynamically.

on a tablet, two cards should be placed in a row and one card should be placed in another row.

on a smartphone, all three cards should have their own row, i.e., three cards will occupy three individual rows.




Note:
*Do not remove the existing classes in the boilerplate.*
*Refer to the video below to get an idea of the assignment.*
*For documentation, refer to Bootstrap version 5.2*
*Content for Cards and Bootstrap CDN has already been made available on the boilerplate.* -->
