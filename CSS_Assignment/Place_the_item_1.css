/* Place the Item -1
You have HTML markup defined, and implement the CSS. Use the flexbox properties.
Make the items appear in a row, such that there is space between the elements and the first, and last one touching the end of the screens.


Note: Also, put the property on the holder such that if more items are added to the holder they don't squish, and instead, just go on to the next row. */
