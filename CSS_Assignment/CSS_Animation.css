/* CSS Animation
Create an animation that makes a square move 600px to the right side and then back in a continuous loop. Use the left CSS property and keyframes properties for this.

The duration of the entire animation should be 2 seconds and it should iterate for infinite times. After 1 second, the box should be on the right end of the screen(by 600px from starting position) and at the end of 2 seconds, it should be back to its starting position.
Note:- Animate only the left property in animation.

Add the necessary styles to the #square

Add the keyframes that make the square move from left to right and back again


Do not modify any class names or ids. */
