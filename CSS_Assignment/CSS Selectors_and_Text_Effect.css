/* CSS Selectors and Text Effect
We have provided you with some HTML and CSS boilerplate. Perform the following steps to complete this task:



Create a pseudo element with content "⬇️⬇️ HOVER ⬇️⬇️" using CSS. Copy the content and arrows from the previous line. This element should be placed before the div element.


The text between the <p> tags should not overflow from the box and the overflowing text should be shown by "... ".


Last, create a hover state of the <p> tag such that when the mouse hovers over the p tag it displays the full text. The hidden text should be visible to the user. */


div::before{
    content: "⬇️⬇️ HOVER ⬇️⬇️";
}

p.long-para {
    width: 200px;
    border: 1px solid;
    white-space: nowrap;
    overflow: hidden;
    text-overflow: ellipsis;
}
p:hover {
  overflow: visible;
  white-space: normal;
}
