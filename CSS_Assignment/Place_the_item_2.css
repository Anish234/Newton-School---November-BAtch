/* Place the item -2
You have HTML markup defined, and implement the CSS. Using Flexbox properties on the element with the class "holder"

Make the items appear in a row, such that all elements are squished together in the center of the row.
Note: Put the property on the holder such that if more items are added to the holder they don't squish, and instead, just go on to the next row.

Do not change the HTML markup, only change the CSS code. */
