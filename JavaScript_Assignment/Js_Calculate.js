// JS Calculate
// easy
// Problem Statement
// Create a function named "calculate" which takes in three arguments. The first and the second arguments are numbers and the third argument is a mathematical operator in the form of a string. The function performs mathematical calculations between the two numbers on the basis of the operator passed as the third argument and prints the result in the console.

// Note- The "calculate" function should only support four operators "+" , "-" , "*" , "/" (without the quotes) where these operators have their usual meaning
// Input
// The "calculate" function takes in three arguments, the first and the second arguments are numbers and the third argument is a mathematical operator in the form of a string.

// Output
// You need to create a function named calculate which prints the result of the calculation between the first and the second argument on the basis of the operator which is the third argument.




// your code is here

function calculate(num1, num2, operator) {
    let result;
    if (operator === "+") {
      result = num1 + num2;
    }
    else if (operator === "-") {
      result = num1 - num2;
    }
    else if (operator === "*") {
      result = num1 * num2;
    }
    else if (operator === "/") {
      result = num1 / num2;
    }
    console.log(result);
    return result;
  }
